#Listing Current Scripts Only.

# How to showcase your full latest versions only #


---


Copy and paste my code in homepage linking my scripts and alter to the code you get

I've added another label "Full" which defines your current latest script, Remove the label when updating!

Then go into download and search by name e.g. label=LV, label=Full

search and copy the address link in the title bar

go into administer/project summary and copy and paste it in as mine has been done

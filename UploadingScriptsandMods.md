# How to Upload Scripts and Mods #

> Welcome to the Google Code Script and Mod repository.  A big thank-you goes to LV for finding out that this was even possible.

> To upload your scripts and mods, you will need to contact one of the project leaders with your email address, or use the account listed in [this Egosoft forum thread](http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=3208297&highlight=#3208297).

## Guidelines for uploading ##

  * It would be immensely helpful for there to be a wiki entry for your script with installation instructions, usage guides, and any other pertinent information such as conflicts.
  * If this information is already listed in your Egosoft forum thread for the script or mod, then a link back to that thread should suffice.
  * Please fill in the labels.
    1. The "XVersion" label is to differentiate between X2: The Threat, X3: Reunion, and X3: Terran Conflict.
    1. The "Type" label is to differentiate between Scripts and MODs, as well as how it is packed -- in SPK format, or files in a compressed archive.
    1. Also, in one of the label fields, please put your name as the author.
